## Troubleshooting

### Permissions issues with /scripts

Set permissions for the repo CLI:

```bash
chmod a+x node_modules/.bin/nr-core-cli
```

### NVM Warning Message About Unsupported Prefix

If you get a message similar to:

```bash
nvm is not compatible with the npm config "prefix" option: currently set to "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew
```

Unset the `default` alias with:

```bash
nvm unalias default
```
