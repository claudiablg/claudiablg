## Foundations

Foundations are principles and rules that guide the rest of the system. This
system includes the following subjects:

- **Colors**: What colors are available to use
- **Colors intents**: how colors should be used
- **Effects**: how shadows, transparency and other special effects are used
- **Sizing**: How to size and space out components
- **Iconography**: How text is presented
- **Typography**: What fonts to use and how text, headings, labels are presented
- **Layout**: How to organize content, for different viewports
- **Animations**: How to animate layers and effects

## Content

Every website or app has to place content (text, images, video, forms, etc) in a
page or a view. As designers and developers we do this quite **often**.

The following is an opinionated way of seeing the content we place on pages. We
call this the **Website API**.

Content is organized with [Pages](/design-system/content/pages/),
[Sections](/design-system/content/sections/) and
[Blocks](/design-system/content/blocks/).

## Additional Resources

No design system is made in a vacuum. Here are our recommended reading list,
references and design systems.
