## Overview

### Foundations

Foundations are principles and rules that guide the rest of the system. This
system includes the following subjects:

- **Colors**: What colors are available to use
- **Colors intents**: how colors should be used
- **Effects**: how shadows, transparency and other special effects are used
- **Sizing**: How to size and space out components
- **Iconography**: How text is presented
- **Typography**: What fonts to use and how text, headings, labels are presented
- **Layout**: How to organize content, for different viewports
- **Animations**: How to animate layers and effects

call this the Website API.

Content is organized in Pages, Sections and Block, you can read about it in the
