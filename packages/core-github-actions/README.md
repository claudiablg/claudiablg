## How to Use

### Development

Normally you will want to start the development build from the root directory to
build all required core packages at once â€” but in some cases you might want to
build just a specific package.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Build

> **Note:** Built lib files are outputted in `/built` where as `/lib` contains
> the tsc output files when compiling all core packages (during development).

To build the github actions files (with `webpack`) run:

```bash
yarn build:built
```

Output files in `/built/` should be commited since we don't compile the actions
code on the build.

### Test

```bash
yarn test
```
