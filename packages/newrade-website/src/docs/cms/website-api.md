# Website API

## About

The WebsiteAPI is a collection of **data models** and matching **React components** that allows fast creation of websites.

### Motivation

Most websites have the same essential data structure: pages, sections, navigation (nav bar, footer, etc), blog, portfolio and so on. Re-implementing or rethinking those for every new website is obliously tedious work.

Hence, the API offers models that should be familiar to anyone having a basic understanding of how a website is structured.

The API is designed with **only** high level models â€” on purpose. The idea is that we want to let users focus on content creation/editing (e.g. writing text content, blog post, adding media, creating pages, reordering sections and blocks...), leaving out any low level details (i.e. the API _does not_ give users control over low level design aspects, those are handled by developers and designers).

## Overview

The Website API is a collection of pure (data only) models (types and interfaces) that can be implemented in most CMSes.

The contract is straightforward :

1. models and data are configured and set up in the CMS
1. using Gatsby, the website data is retrieved with GraphQL queries
1. pages, sections, blocks are rendered to form a complete website

Additionally, all visual aspects of the site are configured by developers and designers in the design system config.
